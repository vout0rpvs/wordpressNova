        I work on a contingency fee, meaning if I don’t get you money for your injuries and damages you don’t pay me anything,
        not even my expenses! When you get paid, I will receive a standard fee set by the Supreme Court of New Jersey.
        When you and I speak during our</p>
        <p>FIRST FREE TELEPHONE CONVERSATION, </p>
        <p>these are some of the questions you may want to ask before setting up a free face to face consultation:

    <div class="">
      <ul>
        <li>Will I receive money for my injuries?</li>

          <li>How will my medical bills be paid?</li>

          <li>What happens if there is a mistake on my police report? How long do I have to notify my insurance company?</li>

          <li>If I missed time from work, will I be compensated for my lost wages?</li>

        Choosing the right attorney is the most crucial step in making sure your case is handled quickly and correctly with the most compensation.
        Always make sure your attorney has the education, experience and expertise to make this as easy as possible for you.</p>
    <p> Beware of Chiropractors, medical clinics, paralegals and others such as insurance adjusters who refer you to lawyers or places for treatment.       </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        They are not lawyers, nor are they qualified to make the RIGHT decision for you. </p>
        <p>Time is against us. Not only will the insurance companies be calling you with attempts to hurt your case, but there is also a statute which limits the amount of time that you have to file your claim.</p>
